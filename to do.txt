to do:
-tutorial messages
-story messages
-after certain rounds of tutorial, popup to go to main game/main menu
-script tutorial stuff to work properly
-somehow fix the stupid collision on walls when hugging
-directional prompt (find enemy when off screen)

done:
-space bar why D: (take input out of fixed update)
-change scale of arena so you can't make the controls wonky bc of the camera
-added the ability to reset player position with the home key in case they clip through the wall via hug bc i don't have time to fix that shit and i don't know how
-decreased damage while hugging
-fix the particle effects with the group hug/blow kiss so the group hug one doesn't show up when it shouldn't and should only appear once
-tutorial separate thing (not just an option)
-pause menu quit button goes back to main menu
-fix the charging thing (halo blink?) (it has a light that blinks now but it doesn't have a steady pattern)
-ADD SOUND
