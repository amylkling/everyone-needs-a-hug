to do:
-somehow fix the stupid collision on walls when hugging
-directional prompt (find enemy when off screen)
-fix the dodging so it actually works in a way that's useful, or get rid of it entirely
-change the way the enemy hurts the player (like swing their arms or shove the player back)
-make kiss particles follow enemy
-change controls: left click toggle targeting, right click hug?

done:
-space bar why D: (take input out of fixed update)
-change scale of arena so you can't make the controls wonky bc of the camera
-added the ability to reset player position with the home key in case they clip through the wall via hug bc i don't have time to fix that shit and i don't know how
-decreased damage while hugging
-fix the particle effects with the group hug/blow kiss so the group hug one doesn't show up when it shouldn't and should only appear once
-tutorial separate thing (not just an option)
-pause menu quit button goes back to main menu
-fix the charging thing (halo blink?) (it has a light that blinks now but it doesn't have a steady pattern)
-ADD SOUND
-after certain rounds of tutorial, popup to go to main game/main menu (changed to be a button the player presses)
-script tutorial stuff to work properly
-tutorial messages
-story messages
-fix the hugging so it latches on properly (i guess it's fixed..)
-fix the group hug enemy movement
-fix the sound sliders in options
