How to Play:

You are a babysitter, tasked with sending kids off to bed. However, the kids are rambunctious and energetic, and don't want to go to bed just yet. They want to play! You only have so much patience for putting up with their shenanigans. You must offer them love and comfort in the form of hugs so that they will calm down and go to sleep.

Chase after the kids and hug them when you get near to deplete their energy. Be careful though, they will fight to stay awake by punching and hitting you! Change your positioning when hugging so you stay out of the way of their flailing. They will also jump at you to engage you in play, which will make you lose some of your patience. You can run or dodge out of the way, or if they're just too fast for you, blow a kiss at them to briefly stun them and shock a little energy out of them. Once you've drained all the rascals of their energy, give 'em a big ol' group hug to send them off to bed! You'll feel relieved - until the next set of kids runs in! Once you've sent every last one to bed, your job will be done. But if you run out of patience at any time, you'll have to give up!
